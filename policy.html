            <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
            <li>
              use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public
              display (commercial or non-commercial);
            </li>
            <li>
              attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained
              on startNg's website;
            </li>
            <li>
              remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the

            </li>
            <li>
              transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the

        use the materials on startNg's website, even if startNg or a startNg
        authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of
        the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not
        allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability
        for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not

        startNg has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is
        not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The
        inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by startNg of the
